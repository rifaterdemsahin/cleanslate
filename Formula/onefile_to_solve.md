Here is the complete Python file that performs all the steps you've outlined:

```python
from git import Repo
import os

# Step 1: Load repo
repo_path = "repo_folder"  # Replace with your repo folder name
repo = Repo(repo_path)

print("Repo loaded successfully!")  # Ensure the repo is loaded

# Step 4: Iterate Over Files
def iterate_files(repo_path):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(repo_path):
        for file in files:
            file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
            yield file_path

# Step 5: Assess and Score Files
def assess_file(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            lines = file.readlines()
        return len(lines)  # Score based on line count
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing {file_path}: {e}")
        return 0

# Step 6: Aggregate Scores
def score_repository(repo_path):
    total_score = 0
    for file_path in iterate_files(repo_path):
        file_score = assess_file(file_path)
        print(f"File: {file_path}, Score: {file_score}")
        total_score += file_score
    return total_score

# Calculate total score for the repository
repo_score = score_repository(repo_path)
print(f"Total repository score: {repo_score}")
```

### How it works:
1. **Load the repository** using the `git` library.
2. **Iterate over all files** in the repo using the `os.walk()` method.
3. **Assess each file** by counting the number of lines in the file (you can modify this to assess based on other metrics).
4. **Aggregate the scores** by summing the individual file scores, and print the total score.

### To run:
- Make sure you have `gitpython` installed: 
  ```bash
  pip install gitpython
  ```
- Replace `"repo_folder"` with the path to your local repository.
- Run the script, and it will load the repo, iterate over the files, assess them, and print out the total score.
